<p align="justify">We are interested about the impact of environment changes (warming, deoxygenation and acidification) on marine microbial communinites. Among questions, the deoxygenation of coastal systems is of primary importance. Oxygen deficiency is spreading in aquatic environments as a consequence of anthropogenic loading of nutrients and global warming. This has strong implications for ecosystems functioning including the expansion of dead zones and severe alterations of global biogeochemical cycles. We aim to advance the knowledge about the consequences of deoxygenation of coastal systems on  microbial metabolisms and the subsequent impacts on their functions at an ecosystem-scale using molecular (paleo)ecology tools.</p>
	
<p align="justify">Currently, our projects include the study of the biogeographical distribution of Hg-cycling microorganisms in the global ocean (<a href="https://ericcapo.github.io/lab/meta-hg.html" target="_blank"><u>Meta-Hg working group</u></a>) and the exploration of the microbial ecology of the Baltic Sea (w Anders Andersson and Elinor Andrén), the Black Sea (w Marco Coolen), Cariaco Basin (w Maria Pachiadaki), Norwegian fjords (w Erik Björn, Andrea Garcia Bravo and Stefan Bertilsson), Swedish fjords (w Carina Bunse, Helena Filipsson, Courtney Stairs and Stefano Bonaglia), Greenland fjords (w Carl Lamborg) and Mayotte coral reefs (w Nick Kamenos and Heidi Burdett).

<h3 class="section-title underline">Lake ecosystems</h3>
<p align="justify">Lake microbial communities are highly sensitive to environmental change and their changes in diversity, composition and abundance could be use as indicators. However, there are 
	still few studies about the temporal and spatial variability in microbial communite pre- and post- environmental disturbances. We use the DNA present in the water and the sedimentary archives of lake systems to provide new knowledge about the spatial and temporal dynamics of lake microbial communities towards a better characterization of their response to environmental change. Among other projects, our <a href="https://www.umu.se/en/research/projects/blade-project-biodiversity-and-lake-analysis-via-a-drone-enabled-environmental-dna-approach/" target="_blank"><u>BLADE project</u></a> aim to use a drone to collect water samples from many Swedish lakes. </p> 
		<p align="justify">Current projects, from either or both water columns and sedimentary archives, include the study of microbial communities from Abisko lakes (w Jan Karlsson), Lake Kassjön (w Johan Rydberg), Lake Ekoln (w Stefan Bertilsson), Lake Biwa (w Narumi Tsugeki), Chinese lakes (w Dongna Yan, Yu Zhao and Yanggheng Liu), peri-alpine lakes (w Isabelle Domaizon and Cécilia Barouillet), New Zealand lakes (w John Pearman), Lake NamCo (w Hendrik Vogel and Camille Thomas). The book Tracking Environmental Change Using Lake Sediments: <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/9783031437984" target="_blank"><u>Volume 6 – Sedimentary DNA</u></a> was release in December 2023. It provides an overview of the sedimentary DNA-based approaches in paleolimnology, and more specifically on the recovery of the DNA preserved in sedimentary archives to study past environmental change. Editors are Eric Capo, Cecilia Barouillet and John Smol. This project is an initiative from the <a href="https://sedadna.github.io/" target="_blank"><u>sedaDNA scientific society</u></a>.</p>
