<h3 class="section-title underline">Modern and past microbes in deoxygenated coastal systems</h3>
<p align="justify">
Oxygen deficiency (anoxia) is spreading in coastal seas and estuaries as a consequence of anthropogenic loading of nutrients and global warming. This has strong implications for ecosystems functioning including the expansion of “dead zones” and severe alterations of global biogeochemical cycles. The overall aim of this project is to advance the knowledge about the consequences of deoxygenation of coastal systems on the microbial metabolisms (respiration, photosynthesis, mercury transformation) and the subsequent impacts on their functions at an ecosystem-scale.

<h3 class="section-title underline">Biogeography of oceanic Hg-cycling microbes</h3>
<p align="justify">This project aims to provide a detailed understanding of the biological controls of MeHg levels in the global ocean. The overarching hypothesis is that biogeographical variations of oceanic Hg-cycling microorganisms are mainly shaped by local physical and chemical conditions, implying a differentiated capacity of resident microbial populations and communities to drive Hg-cycling processes. This project make use a curated up-to-date catalogue of Hg-cycling genes and a consensus protocol to detect Hg-cycling genes from environmental metagenomes designed by the <a href="https://ericcapo.github.io/lab/meta-hg.html" target="_blank"><u>Meta-Hg working group</u></a>.</p>

<h3 class="section-title underline">Long-term dynamics of lake microbial communities</h3>
<p align="justify">We use the sedimentary DNA approach to study the long-term temporal dynamics of the microbial communities of lake systems and their response to environmental changes. Current projects included the 160 years dynamics of the microbial eukaryotic communnity from Lake Biwa (lead by Eric Capo, collaboration with Narumi Tsugeki) and 1000 years changes in phototrophs from Lake Ekoln (lead by Maïlys Picard, collaboration with Stefan Bertilsson). We also have ongoing collaborations on projects using sedimentary DNA from Wyoming lakes (lead Jordan Von Eggers), southwestern and northeastern China (lead Dongna Yan).</p>
<p align="justify">The book “Tracking Environmental Change Using Lake Sediments: Volume 6 – Sedimentary DNA” is currently in writing and it aims to provide an overview of the sedimentary DNA-based approaches in paleolimnology, and more specifically on the recovery of the DNA preserved in sedimentary archives to study past environmental changes. Editors are Eric Capo, Cecilia Barouillet and John Smol. This project is an initiative from the <a href="https://sedadna.github.io/" target="_blank"><u>sedaDNA scientific society</u></a> </p>
