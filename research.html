<h3 class="section-title underline">Microbial ecology of Arctic, temperate and tropical coastal systems</h3>
<p align="justify">We are interested about the impact of environment changes (warming, deoxygenation and acidification) on marine microbial communinites. Among questions, the deoxygenation of coastal systems is of primary importance. Oxygen deficiency is spreading in aquatic environments as a consequence of anthropogenic loading of nutrients and global warming. This has strong implications for ecosystems functioning including the expansion of dead zones and severe alterations of global biogeochemical cycles. We aim to advance the knowledge about the consequences of deoxygenation of coastal systems on  microbial metabolisms and the subsequent impacts on their functions at an ecosystem-scale using molecular (paleo)ecology tools.</p>
	
<p align="justify">Currently, our projects include the study of the biogeographical distribution of Hg-cycling microorganisms in the global ocean (<a href="https://ericcapo.github.io/lab/meta-hg.html" target="_blank"><u>Meta-Hg working group</u></a>) and the exploration of the microbial ecology of the Baltic Sea (w Anders Andersson and Elinor Andrén), the Black Sea (w Marco Coolen), Cariaco Basin (w Maria Pachiadaki), Norwegian fjords water columns (w Erik Björn) and Mayotte coral reefs (w Nick Kamenos and Heidi Burdett). Ongoing collaborations include the study of microorganisms from the Venice lagoon (w Andrea Garcia Bravo), Mar Menor (w Isabel Ferrera), Greek seas (w Chrysoula Gubili), Greenland fjords (with Carl Lamborg) and the Southern ocean (w Linda Armbrecht).</p>

<h3 class="section-title underline">Long-term dynamics of lake microbial communities</h3>
<p align="justify">Lake microbial communities are highly sensitive to environmental change and their changes in diversity, composition and abundance could be use as indicators. However, there are only few long-term series that encompass their temporal dynamics pre- and post- environmental disturbances. We use the DNA preserved in lake sedimentary archives to provide new long-term time series of lake microbial communities towards a better characterization of their response to environmental change. </p>
	
<p align="justify">Current projects include the study of microbial communities from Lake Biwa (w Narumi Tsugeki, 160 years), Lake Ekoln (w Stefan Bertilsson, 1000 years). Ongoing collaborations focus on Wyoming lakes (w Jordan Von Eggers), peri-alpine lakes (w Isabelle Domaizon and Cécilia Barouillet), New Zealand lakes (w John Pearman), Lake Chenghai and Sihailongwan Maar Lake (w Dongna Yan) and Lake NamCo (w Hendrik Vogel and Camille Thomas).</p>
		
<p align="justify">The <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/9783031437984" target="_blank"><u>book</u></a> Tracking Environmental Change Using Lake Sediments: Volume 6 – Sedimentary DNA will be published in December 2023. It aims to provide an overview of the sedimentary DNA-based approaches in paleolimnology, and more specifically on the recovery of the DNA preserved in sedimentary archives to study past environmental change. Editors are Eric Capo, Cecilia Barouillet and John Smol. This project is an initiative from the <a href="https://sedadna.github.io/" target="_blank"><u>sedaDNA scientific society</u></a>.</p>
