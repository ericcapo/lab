		<h1>Eric Capo, aquatic microbial ecology lab</h1>
		<p align="justify">Welcome to our research group, where we are dedicated to exploring the ecology of marine and freshwater systems. Our focus lies in understanding the temporal dynamics of microbial communities and their functional responses to environmental changes, such as climate, eutrophication, and mercury pollution. Specifically our main research lines are centered on investigating the consequences of water column climate-induced deoxygenation  and freshwater to brackish transition of water columns in both modern and past times. We achieve this through the use of advanced molecular ecology approaches, such as (ancient) metagenomics, MAGs-based analysis and metatranscriptomics. In doing so, we aim to unravel the complex interactions between microbial metabolisms and their environment. By combining our expertise in microbial ecology and molecular biology techniques, we strive to shed light on the intricate relationships between microbial communities and their environment.</p>
