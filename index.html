		<h1>Eric Capo, aquatic microbial ecology lab</h1>
		<p align="justify">Welcome to our research group, where we are dedicated to exploring the ecology of marine and freshwater systems. Our focus lies in understanding the temporal dynamics of microbial communities and their functional responses to environmental changes, such as climate, eutrophication, and mercury pollution. Our main research line is centered on investigating the consequences of deoxygenation in both past and modern marine environments. We achieve this through the use of advanced molecular ecology approaches, such as (ancient) metagenomics, MAGs-based analysis and metatranscriptomics. In doing so, we aim to unravel the complex interactions between microbial metabolisms and their environment. We are also working on the responses of lake microbial communities to environmental changes. By combining our expertise in microbial ecology and molecular biology techniques, we strive to shed light on the intricate relationships between microbial communities and their environment.</p>

		<p align="justify">We are located at the Department of Ecology and Environmental Science (<a href="https://www.umu.se/en/department-of-ecology-and-environmental-science/" target="_blank"><b>EMG</b></a>) at Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden</p>
