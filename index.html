		<h1>Aquatic microbial ecology lab</h1>
		<p align="justify">We explore the ecology of marine and freshwater systems with a focus on <b>aquatic microorganisms</b> (bacteria, archaea and protists). Our focus lies in understanding the temporal dynamics of microbial communities and their functional responses to <b>environmental change</b>, such as climate, eutrophication, and mercury pollution. Specifically our main research lines are centered on investigating the consequences of climate-induced deoxygenation and freshwater-to-brackish transitions (and vice versa) of water columns on their microbial communities. We achieve this through the use of advanced <b>molecular ecology</b> approaches, such as metabarcoding, (ancient) metagenomics, MAGs-based analysis and metatranscriptomics. By combining genetic information from past and modern environments, we strive to shed light on the intricate relationships between microbial communities and their environment.</p>
