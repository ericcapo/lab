		<h1>Eric Capo, aquatic microbial ecology lab</h1>
		<p align="justify">Welcome to our research group, where we are dedicated to exploring the ecology of marine and freshwater systems with a focus on <b>aquatic microorganisms</b> (bacteria, archaea and protists).</p> 
			
		<p align="justify">Our focus lies in understanding the temporal dynamics of microbial communities and their functional responses to <b>environmental change</b>, such as climate, eutrophication, and mercury pollution. Specifically our main research lines are centered on investigating the consequences of climate-induced deoxygenation and freshwater-to-brackish transitions (and vice versa) of water columns on their microbial communities. We achieve this through the use of advanced <b>molecular ecology</b> approaches, such as metabarcoding, (ancient) metagenomics, MAGs-based analysis and metatranscriptomics. By combining genetic information from past and modern environments, we strive to shed light on the intricate relationships between microbial communities and their environment.</p>

		<p align="justify">We are located at the Department of Ecology and Environmental Science (<a href="https://www.umu.se/en/department-of-ecology-and-environmental-science/" target="_blank"><b>EMG</b></a>) at Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden.</p>
